# About me
I am currently completing my Master's degree in electronical and instrumentation at Universitas Gadjah Mada, following a Bachelor's degree in Physics with a specialization in Electronics & Instrumentation from Universitas Sebelas Maret. My research focus is on domain-specific hardware architectures and accelerators using FPGAs, especially for real-time biomedical signal processing.

## Research and Publication

### Publikasi Terbaru: "Sistem Deteksi Hipertensi Berbasis Luas Sinyal Fotopletismogram Menggunakan K-Nearest Neighbor"
[Tautan ke jurnal/prosiding][(http://link-jurnal-anda.com](https://jurnal.untan.ac.id/index.php/jepin/article/view/91145))

- Tanggal publikasi: 2024
- Fokus: This paper presents a non-invasive system for hypertension level classification based on morphological features extracted from the Photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal. The system utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm and was validated using data from human subjects, demonstrating the feasibility of using PPG signals for hypertension screening
